# skill-clean-audit

> First-Principles Clean Code Auditor — a **read-only, readable, reusable** agent skill. Current version **v1.3.0**.
> 第一性原理 Clean Code 审计法 —— 一个**只读、可读、可复用**的 Agent Skill。当前版本 **v1.3.0**。

**Compliance / 合规**: purely local, read-only audit — no network, no credentials, no third-party APIs; provides / instructs / supports no means to circumvent network-management measures. See *Compliance & Boundary Statement* in SKILL.md.

From one root premise — **"code is written for humans"** — it derives two criteria and scores code red / amber / green, explicitly permitting *intentional, documented, scoped* tech debt to remain.

Built to audit your own **WorkBuddy / Claude / any-agent skill scripts** or other Python code, emitting an evidence-backed (`file:line`) checklist report. **This skill reads only, never edits** — fixes go to the next pass.

## Why it is not "yet another clean-code skill" / 为什么它不是「又一个 clean code skill」

Three families of related skills exist; this one occupies the gap none of them fills well:

| Red ocean | Representative | Our difference |
|---|---|---|
| App / PR code (correctness·security·perf) | code-review, review-pr, smart-code-review | Audits readability / maintainability only (comprehension & change risk), not correctness |
| Rule handbooks | clean-code (SRP/DRY/KISS) | Rules are *derived*, not dogmatic givens |
| Skill security | skill-vetting, agent-skills-audit | Audits only its own scripts' readability — zero network, zero credentials, read-only |

**Three differentiators / 三个差异化**: ① rules derived from first principles; ② two axes (cost vs risk), not category buckets; ③ permits intentional debt (amber tier).

## First-Principles Derivation / 第一性原理推导

1. **Root premise / 根前提**: code is written for humans. Machines only care whether syntax is valid, not naming / length / comments; code's real life is in the countless times it is read, modified, and maintained by another person (including future you).
2. From this, only two criteria follow / 由此只推出两根判据:
   - **A. Comprehension cost / 理解成本** — intent and boundaries obvious at a glance.
   - **B. Change risk / 修改风险** — a change doesn't quietly break something else.
3. Every concrete rule is a subtree of these two. Anything that fails "does it actually lower comprehension or change cost?" is noise.

> **Key reversal / 关键反推**: checklist-for-its-own-sake (splitting into tiny functions to be short, abstracting unused interfaces for DRY) raises cost — that is dirty.

---

## Severity (Red / Amber / Green) / 严重度（红 / 黄 / 绿）

- 🔴 **Red · dirty on sight, fix first / 红 · 出现即脏，优先修**: implicit `import *`, contradictory docs, comments degraded into a changelog, module-level mutable global controlling behavior, name≠behavior / hidden side effects (CQS violation), duplicated logic (DRY violation), bare `except` swallowing errors.
- 🟡 **Amber · intentional debt, needs comment + scope / 黄 · 有意的债，需注释 + 范围可控**: long functions (>40 lines but cohesive), unnamed magic numbers/strings, intentional best-effort `except`. Amber = temporarily acceptable, but the "why" must be written and the scope controlled.
- 🟢 **Green · clean on sight / 绿 · 出现即干净**: naming is documentation, explicit beats implicit, behavior depends only on inputs, tested, every `except` is precise.

## Usage / 用法

### In WorkBuddy / 在 WorkBuddy 里

Place the whole directory at `~/.workbuddy/skills/skill-clean-audit/`, then in chat say:

> "Audit `~/.workbuddy/skills/demo-skill/scripts/aggregate.py` with first principles"
> 「用第一性原理审一下 `~/.workbuddy/skills/demo-skill/scripts/aggregate.py`」

or any trigger / 或任一触发词: comprehension/change risk, clean code audit, audit my skill scripts, score code red/amber/green.

It copies `assets/clean_code_checklist.html` (Chinese) or `assets/clean_code_checklist.en.html` (English) into your workspace and writes the report to `<workspace>/clean_code_audit_<target>.md`.

> **Pick language / 选语言**: say `zh` to force Chinese, `en` to force English, or leave it for `auto` (follows your message). See *Language Selection* in SKILL.md.

### Porting the method to other platforms / 方法论迁移到其他平台

The *Boundary Statement* in SKILL.md names WorkBuddy's equivalent skills (e.g. `code-review-assistant`). The method is platform-agnostic — apply its two criteria + red/amber/green to any script on your platform; no rewrite needed.

---

## Boundaries vs Other Tools (avoid overlap) / 与其他工具的边界（避免重叠）

- ❌ Generic PR/MR review → use your platform's PR-review tool
- ❌ Code-style handbook → use clean-code (SRP/DRY/KISS)
- ❌ Lint / format → use project-code-standard (ruff/eslint/prettier)
- ✅ This skill only does **first-principles readability / maintainability audit**, and **reads only, never edits**
